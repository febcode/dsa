Here’s how you should answer these System Design questions in interviews —

In an interview, you should not jump directly to the solution.
Instead, you should speak in a structured way, something like:

1. Clarify requirements first (even if it seems obvious):

- "Is this a prototype or production-ready system?"
- "Do we need user login?"
- "Are we expecting heavy traffic?"

Example:
"For URL shortening, should we also handle link expiry or analytics?"

2. List Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:

Functional = What system should do

Non-Functional = Speed, scalability, security, reliability

3. Think about High-Level Components:
(Draw rough architecture in mind or say it aloud)

- Frontend
- Backend
- Database
- APIs
- External services (e.g., AWS S3, third-party APIs)

4. Talk about Database Design:

- What tables?

- What fields?

- How to query efficiently?

5. Briefly Discuss Scaling (optional if time permits):

- Caching (Redis, Memcached)

- Load Balancer

- Sharding / Partitioning

6. Summarize by connecting components together in 2 lines.


Here's a short answer for "Design a URL Shortener"

> "Okay, first I'll clarify:

We need a service where a user inputs a long URL, and the system gives a short link. When someone clicks the short link, it redirects them back to the original URL. Optional features could be expiry time, analytics.

For high level design:

- Frontend with simple form to submit URL.

- Backend will generate a short code (say, a 6-character random string) and map it to the original URL in a database.

- I'll use something like Base62 encoding (using alphabets + numbers) to keep the link short.

- Database can have a simple table with ShortCode, OriginalURL, CreatedAt, and maybe Expiry.

- If traffic grows, we can add caching and load balancers later."


If time allows or if interviewer asks, you can then mention extra things like:

- Rate limiting to prevent spam

- Security (prevent malicious URLs)

- Redundancy (replicate DB)

- Monitoring


In short, you can speak in this order:

1. Clarify requirements
2. List components 
3. Talk about database
4. Optional: Talk about scalability 
5. Summarize neatly.
