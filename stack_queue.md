# tack vs Queue ðŸ“¤ 

Stack ðŸ“¥:

Purpose: Data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).

Think of: A pile of plates â€” last plate you put on is the first one you take off.

Usage: Function calls, undo features in editors.

Operations: Push (add), Pop (remove).

Top Access Only: You can only access the top item directly.

Real-world vibe: Like a stack of books â€” take the one on top first.


Queue ðŸ“¤:

Purpose: Data structure that follows FIFO (First In, First Out).

Think of: A line at the ticket counter â€” first person in line gets served first.

Usage: Task scheduling, printer jobs, messaging systems.

Operations: Enqueue (add), Dequeue (remove).

Front & Rear Access: Add from one end, remove from the other.

Real-world vibe: Like waiting in a food truck queue.
